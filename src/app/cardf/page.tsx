      Finance and Economy:
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6 text-white">
      Finance is centered primarily on the management of money, and involves assessing different components of financial systems,
       such as banking, credit, and investments. Economics is a broader and more theoretical realm of study, one that focuses on 
       the production and distribution of resources throughout a society.
       Finance can be understood as the management of money. As an area of study, finance looks at wealth, currency, and capital assets, such as property and stocks.

Broadly speaking, finance can be categorised into 3 distinct groups:

personal finance
corporate finance
public finance.
If you work in finance, your job may involve investing, lending, budgeting, and forecasting on behalf of individuals, organisations, or governments. Financial practices can 
include understanding cash flow, profit, interest rates, relationships with shareholders, risk and return, and creating value.
Economics is a branch of knowledge connected to everyday life in different ways throughout history and societies. It's often concerned with the production, exchange, consumption, and scarcity of wealth and resources.

As a social science, economics can be used to analyse the behaviour of individuals or groups by looking closer at what makes people act on certain choices. Governments of all countries are advised by 
economists to implement various policies to run the country well.
